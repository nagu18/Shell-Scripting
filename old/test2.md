Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of the code snippets you provided and how they check for an SSH connection:

**Checking for a Value with `-n`:**

- `-n`: This is a test operator used with the `test` command (or the `[]` brackets) to check if a string has a non-zero length.
- In simpler terms, it checks if a string has any characters in it, not just an empty string.

**Checking for SSH Connection:**

- `$SSH_TTY`: This is a special environment variable set by the SSH server when a connection is established via SSH. It typically contains the path to the terminal device being used for the SSH session.

**`test -n $SSH_TTY` and `[ -n $SSH_TTY ]`**

- Both of these expressions achieve the same outcome: they check if the `$SSH_TTY` variable has a value (i.e., is not empty).
  - If `$SSH_TTY` has a value (meaning an SSH connection exists), the expression evaluates to true (exit code 0).
  - If `$SSH_TTY` is empty (no SSH connection), the expression evaluates to false (non-zero exit code).

**Key Points:**

- These expressions provide a simple way to determine if the current connection is through SSH.
- They are often used in shell scripts to perform specific actions only when a user is connected via SSH.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
if test -n "$SSH_TTY"; then
  echo "You are connected via SSH."
else
  echo "This is not an SSH connection."
fi
```

**Alternative Syntax:**

The `[ ` and `test` commands are often interchangeable for simple expressions. However, some shells might have slight differences in their behavior.

I hope this explanation clarifies how these code snippets work in checking for an SSH connection!
