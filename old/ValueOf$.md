## Understanding Exit Status in Bash Scripting

### Introduction

This README aims to provide a brief explanation of the concepts related to successful and non-successful script execution in Bash scripting using the exit status.

### Exit Status Overview

In Bash scripting, every command or script that is executed returns an exit status, which is a numeric value indicating whether the execution was successful or encountered an error.

- An exit status of `0` generally signifies a successful execution.
- Non-zero exit statuses typically indicate an error or failure.

### Example Scenario

Let's consider the following scenario using a Bash script (`Myscript.sh`):

```bash
bash ./Myscript.sh
echo $?
```

In this example:
1. The script `Myscript.sh` is executed using the `bash` command.
2. Immediately after the script execution, `echo $?` is used to display the exit status of the last executed command.

### Interpreting Results

#### Successful Script Execution:

If the script (`Myscript.sh`) runs without encountering any issues, the exit status will be `0`, indicating success. The output of `echo $?` would be:

```bash
0
```

#### Non-Successful Script Execution:

If the script encounters an error or fails to execute properly, the exit status will be a non-zero value. The output of `echo $?` would then indicate the specific non-zero exit status, signifying the nature of the issue.

### Using Exit Status in Scripts

In practical scenarios, exit statuses are often used in scripts for conditional branching and error handling. Script authors can check the exit status to determine the success or failure of preceding commands and take appropriate actions.

### Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing exit statuses in Bash scripting is crucial for writing robust and reliable scripts. By interpreting exit statuses, script authors can enhance error handling and create more resilient automation.
