The chmod +x command is used to make a file executable in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. The chmod command stands for "change mode," and the +x option specifically grants the execute permission to a file.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

chmod: The command used to change file permissions.
+x: The option that adds the execute permission.
So, when you run chmod +x filename, you are giving the file named "filename" the permission to be executed as a program or script. Once a file has execute permission, you can run it using its filename, provided that the file contains a valid script or executable code.

In the context of your previous request, when you run chmod +x chmod.sh, you are making the chmod.sh file executable, and then you can execute it using ./chmod.sh.
