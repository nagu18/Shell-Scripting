In a shell, the "which" command is not used to find the path of a file. Instead, you can use the "which" command to locate the executable file associated with a given command in your shell's PATH. For example:

```bash
which ls
```

This command would output the path to the "ls" executable.

If you want to find the path of a specific file, you can use the "realpath" or "readlink" command. For example:

```bash
realpath /path/to/your/file
```

Or

```bash
readlink -f /path/to/your/file
```

Replace "/path/to/your/file" with the actual path to the file you're interested in. These commands will give you the full, absolute path of the specified file.
